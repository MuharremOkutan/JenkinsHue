# JenkinsHue [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fi3te/JenkinsHue.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fi3te/JenkinsHue)

This is the implementation of my IHK project (Fiete Wennier, June 2016). It shows the state of multiple jenkins builds using Philips hue lamps. The application can handle multiple lamps und bridges (Philips products).

## Getting started

### Requirements
- Jenkins server
- Philips Hue Bridge
- Philips Hue lamps (e.g. Philips Hue Go)
- LDAP server (recommended, not necessary)

### Usage
- Download the latest release
- Unzip the release
- Set the required properties in the application.properties file
- Run it with...
```sh
java -jar name_of_the_jar.jar
```
- Visit [http://localhost:8484/](http://localhost:8484/)
- If no ldap connection is specified you can login with username = password (property 'admins')

### Bridge discovery

The bridge can be discovered automatically via N-UPnP. Therefore it needs an internet connection.

Otherwise you can also type in the IP address ot the bridge manually.

Further information can be found [here](https://developers.meethue.com/documentation/hue-bridge-discovery).


## How Does It Work

The application uses the REST-API of your Jenkins server and recognizes states changes of the observed builds. On the basis of the occured scenarios (multiple builds -> multiple scenarios) it decides which scenario should be shown (the scenarios can be prioritized). Possible scenarios are:

- BUILDING after FAILURE
- BUILDING after UNSTABLE
- BUILDING after SUCCESS
- FAILURE after SUCCESS
- FAILURE after UNSTABLE
- FAILURE after FAILURE
- UNSTABLE after SUCCESS
- UNSTABLE after FAILURE
- UNSTABLE after UNSTABLE
- SUCCESS after FAILURE
- SUCCESS after UNSTABLE
- SUCCESS after SUCCESS

You can also configure fallback scenarios:

- BUILDING
- FAILURE
- UNSTABLE
- SUCCESS

For each scenario you can define (colored) pulsation and color change.

### The Hue SDK by Philips

Philips releases this SDK with friendly house rules. These friendly house rules are part of a legal framework; this to protect both the developers and hue. The friendly house rules cover e.g. the naming of Philips and of hue which can only be used as a reference (a true and honest statement) and not as a an brand or identity. Also covered is that the hue SDK and API can only be used for hue and for no other application or product. Very common sense friendly rules that are common practice amongst leading brands that have released their SDKâ€™s.
